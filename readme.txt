# WebGL-Orb GitHub Pages site

1. Create a new **public** repository on GitHub named `<your-username>.github.io`  
   (or any repo and enable Pages in Settings → Pages → Source → branch `main` / `/root`).

2. Upload all files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `orb.js`) to the root of the repo.

3. Commit & push.  
   Within ~30 s your site is live at `https://<your-username>.github.io`.

4. Hack away: edit `orb.js` to swap shaders, add post-effects, load textures, etc.

All assets are static—GitHub Pages limitation satisfied. Enjoy!
